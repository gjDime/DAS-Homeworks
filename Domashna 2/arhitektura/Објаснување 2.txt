Login Controller - Login Service - User Repository
When logging in, the Login Controller will receive the request from the MVC Controller and forward it to the Login Service.

Business Controller - Business Service - LSTM Service - Business/Price Log Repository
When searching for companies, the Business Controller will receive the request from the MVC Controller and forward it to the Business Service. The main business logic of the application will reside in this service. It will select the company and retrieve historical data for it. Data retrieval will be done via the Business and Price Log Repositories. A request will then be sent to the LSTM Service, which will predict the stock price for the next month for the selected company.
